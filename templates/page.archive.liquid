<h2>Ship Time</h2>
<p>Shipping times are dependant upon location (everything outside of Canada will be shipped internationally). However
    product will be packaged and posted within 1 week unless otherwise noted at this time. If you are located in, or
    making a trip to, London, Ontario, Canada, please select the "local pickup" option and make a special note in your
    order about when you might be able to meet somewhere downtown (we'll be in touch)!</p>
<h2><span>Quality/Colour</span></h2>
<p><span>Every effort is taken to produce a photo of the product such that accurately represents the colour of the skein. However, due to differences in computer screen calibration and local lighting, products may appear slightly different in person. Do not hesitate to reach out with any concerns. </span>
</p>
<h2><span>Refunds</span></h2>
<p><span>While at this time we are unable to offer returns or exchanges, please contact me about any issues you may have with the yarn. Associated products (such as yarn bowls or other notions) are final sale at this time.</span>
</p>
<h2><span>Packing</span></h2>
<p><span>A Note on Packaging: Most yarn will arrive in Noissue compostable mailers. You can find more information about them on <a
                href="https://www.noissue.ca/custom-packaging/compostable-biodegradable-mailers" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>. Anything larger will likely be shipped in a reused cardboard box or other reused material to reduce waste and maximize material use before it reaches the landfill. Please know that every effort is taken to ensure that your yarn arrives safely.</span>
